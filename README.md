### Courses
- **Next.js Course with TechConMe**: I developed multiple workshops to help individuals learn how to code and upskill their careers, focusing on building applications using Next.js. You can explore this series more at [TechConMe - YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH72tRyNBul4xwHGPuduuoUuQ1b2qz1Bc) or in the repo of the [course](https://github.com/Yosolita1978/Conference-Landing)

#### Projects
- **Bulls and Cows**: A code-breaking game where players guess a secret number with clues given in terms of "bulls" (correct digits in the correct position) and "cows" (correct digits in the wrong position). Visit [bulls.yosola.co](https://bulls.yosola.co/)
- **Mexican Recipes Chatbot**: A unique creationâ€”my mother-in-law's recipe bot! This innovative chatbot is a digital treasure trove, housing all the traditional Mexican recipes our family has cherished and shared via email. Visit [recetas.yosola.co](https://recetas.yosola.co/)
- ðŸ”­ **My Mom and Me**: Currently working on developing a project with photos of my mom and mine to generate a model that tells us how much we look alike. You can see a first draft of that work in [this Jupiter note](https://github.com/Yosolita1978/MyMomAndMe)
